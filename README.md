# imap for [Cull](https://cull.email)

A minimal IMAP client interface exposing mailboxes, envelopes and messages.

## Limitations

This library is neither feature complete nor __Production Readyâ„¢__.

It is intended for short-lived connections and is generally useful as an introduction to IMAP and for quickly retrieving mailboxes, envelopes and message data in most cases.

The following is not currently implemented:

* Insecure (non-TLS) connections. _See [Cleartext Considered Obsolete: Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for Email Submission and Access](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8314)_
* Automatic UTF-7 encoding/decoding.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @cull/imap
```

## Usage

```js
import Client from '@cull/imap';

let c = new Client({
  host: 'mail.example.com',
  user: 'user@example.com',
  pass: 'password',
});

async () => {
  try {
    await c.connect();
    let mailboxes = await c.mailboxes();
    let envelopes = await c.envelopes('some/mailbox');
    let messages = await c.messages('inbox', '1:3');
    let headers = await c.headers('inbox');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } finally {
    await c.disconnect();
  }
}();
```
